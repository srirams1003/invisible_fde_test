# Security Considerations

## Overview
I've implemented several security measures in this banking service to protect user data and financial transactions. The system uses industry-standard practices while keeping things simple and maintainable.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Authentication
- Uses HS256 algorithm with a configurable secret key
- Tokens expire after 30 minutes (configurable)
- All API endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage

### Access Control
- Users can only access their own accounts and data
- All endpoints validate ownership before allowing access
- No hardcoded credentials - everything uses environment variables

## Data Protection

### Database Security
- SQLAlchemy ORM prevents SQL injection attacks
- All database queries use parameterized statements
- Database file is excluded from git (not committed)

### Input Validation
- Pydantic schemas validate all incoming data
- Email format validation for user registration
- Amount validation for transactions
- Card number format validation

## Financial Security

### Transaction Safety
- All transactions are atomic (all-or-nothing)
- Balance checks before withdrawals
- Users can only transfer between their own accounts
- Complete transaction history is maintained

### Card Security
- Only last 4 digits of card numbers are stored
- Cards are tied to specific accounts
- Card numbers are masked in responses

## Environment Security

### Configuration
```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./banking.db
```

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Change SECRET_KEY to a secure random string
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Set up proper monitoring
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Regular security updates

## Security Measures Implemented

### What I Protected Against
- **SQL Injection**: Using SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Data Exposure**: Proper access controls
- **Unauthorized Access**: JWT authentication
- **Invalid Data**: Input validation with Pydantic
- **Financial Errors**: Atomic transactions and balance checks

### What I Didn't Implement (Yet)
- Rate limiting (would need Redis or similar)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Database encryption at rest
- Advanced fraud detection
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP)

## Notes
As this is a demo project, I focused on core security principles rather than enterprise-level features. For production use, you'd want to add rate limiting, monitoring, and more comprehensive logging.
